# Ray-tracing-graphics-
Learning Computer Graphics.

# How I worked?
In this process, I did (and will do) some projects and implementations of the base code of Computer Graphic in C++ and Python. The goal learn the basis and solve the problems and explain it. Notice, some of the code is just as the same of the classes I'm using, so please go and check the books.
